Welcome back to another exciting episode of Data, Java, and Jokes. I'm your host, Riedwaan Bassadien, and today we have a special guest with us, Rory Preddy. Now, Rory is not your average Java guru. In fact, the first time I met him, he was training an AI model to be sarcastic. Yes, you heard that right, a sarcastic AI. I asked how it was doing, and it replied, \"Oh, I'm living the dream, can't you tell?\" Classic Rory!\n\nRory is a Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft, where he helps professional cloud developers discover and successfully use Microsoft's platforms. He is not only a seasoned speaker, but his talks are also highly engaging and informative. With his expertise in Java and his passion for technology, Rory brings a unique perspective to the table.\n\nIn this episode, we'll dive into Rory's journey as a Java guru and explore his work at Microsoft. We'll also discuss his adventures in training a sarcastic AI model and how it ties into the world of data. And of course, we'll have our usual dose of jokes that are so bad, they're actually good.\n\nSo, join us as we unravel the world of Java, data, and sarcasm with Rory Preddy.

I'm your host, Riedwaan Bassadien, and today we have a special guest with us, Rory Preddy. Now, Rory is not your average Java guru. In fact, the first time I met him, he was training an AI model to be sarcastic. Yes, you heard that right, a sarcastic AI. I asked how it was doing, and it replied, \"Oh, I'm living the dream, can't you tell?\" Classic Rory!\n\nRory is a Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft, where he helps professional cloud developers discover and successfully use Microsoft's platforms. He is not only a seasoned speaker, but his talks are also highly engaging and informative. With his expertise in Java and his passion for technology, Rory brings a unique perspective to the table.\n\nIn this episode, we'll dive into Rory's journey as a Java guru and explore his work at Microsoft. We'll also discuss his adventures in training a sarcastic AI model and how it ties into the world of data. And of course, we'll have our usual dose of jokes that are so bad, they're actually good.\n\nSo, join us as we unravel the world of Java, data, and sarcasm with Rory Preddy.
